Optimum operational conditions of hybrid photovoltaic-thermal systems
by Douglas Bressan Riffel, Jose Aguiar dos Santos Junior and Andre Luiz de Moraes Costa

Highlights
• It is an approach to find the maximum cell temperature in an hybrid/cogeneration system that keeps the exergy of the system, quantifying the quality of the produced energies.
• This is a very important issue for proper design of cogeneration plants.
• Based on this approach, a maximum exergy point tracking can be developed.
